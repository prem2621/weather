## 💡 Weather App — Real-time Weather Forecast
✍️ Why I Created This Project

This project was built as part of a technical assessment from Aganitha Cognitive Solutions.
The goal of this assessment was to demonstrate my ability to:

- Build a functional and clean React-based web application. 
- Integrate external APIs and handle real-world data dynamically. 
- Design an interactive, user-friendly UI/UX using responsive design principles. 
- The idea behind this project is simple yet practical — to provide users with real-time weather information for any city they search for, with a minimal and intuitive interface.

# 🌦️ ClimateCraft – Your Daily Weather Companion!
